# Project 2 -- Going The (Social) Distance
### Members:
- Jay Jackson
- Kristan Pruett
- Vineet Skriti
- Andrew Walker

## Rationale
For those seeking to see more than the inside of their living rooms, we'll build a site that can inform users of outdoor opportunities for camping, climbing, and hiking. The site will aggreagate data for what's available in a determined area, and hopefully provide functional data to help the user plan their excursion (such as weather and local "attractions").

## Dataset
### Base Project APIs:
- Mountain Project: https://www.mountainproject.com
- Hiking Project: https://www.hikingproject.com/data
### Additonal data options:
- Census Data
- Weather API
- Marijauna dispensary list

## Screenshots
On Github Repo

## Sketch of final design
1. Pull city data (100+ cities) to database
2. HTML site generated by Flask and Postgres
3. Update site based on user input
 
- Enter location (city, state)
- Select parameters for each API - check boxes, radio buttons, dropdowns
- Map - pins for each location, hover over for additional details
- Tables - campsites, trails, climbs filterable by type/difficulty/length/etc.
